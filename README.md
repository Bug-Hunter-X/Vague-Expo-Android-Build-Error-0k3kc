# Vague Expo Android Build Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The error message itself is often unhelpful, making debugging challenging. This example showcases the problem and a potential solution.

## Problem

Attempting to build an Android APK using `expo build:android` results in a vague error message, lacking specific details about the root cause.  This makes identifying the source of the problem difficult.

## Solution

Solutions typically involve verifying the proper installation and configuration of the Android SDK, NDK, and Gradle.  Checking for version mismatches and ensuring all necessary dependencies are correctly configured is crucial.  Sometimes, cleaning the project or reinstalling the Android build tools can resolve the issue.  More complex situations may require deeper investigation into the logs generated during the build process.
