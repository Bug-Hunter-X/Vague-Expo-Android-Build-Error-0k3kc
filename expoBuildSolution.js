The solution involves a multi-step process to check the Android environment and rebuild:

1. **Verify Android SDK and NDK installations:** Ensure both are installed and that the correct paths are configured in your environment variables.
2. **Check Gradle version:**  Use `./gradlew -v` to check the Gradle version used by your project.  Ensure it's compatible with the Expo CLI version and the Android build tools.
3. **Clean the project:**  Remove the `android` and `node_modules` directories, then reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. **Reinstall Android build tools:** Update or reinstall the Android SDK Build-Tools, ensuring you have the necessary versions for your project.
5. **Review build logs:** The error message might refer to an error further up in the logs. If available, examine more detailed log output during the build process to locate more specific error information.
